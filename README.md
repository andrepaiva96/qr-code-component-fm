## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to manipulate flex boxes so that I can display content on the front end to my liking.
This project was really great to understand how I can get a flexbox to stick a footer to the bottom of the page and center align content.

### Continued development

I will continue my development in understanding flex boxes in greater detail. And implementing the use of media queries in the future for smaller viewports/devices.
I would also like to implement to use of Grids in future projects so that I can increase my understanding in them as well.

### Useful resources

- [FlexBox Guid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This really helped me understand how flexboxes work and how to use them in my code.
- [Media Queries](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/) - This was useful to understand how to manipulate the viewport when it comes to smaller devices. However I didn't end up using a media query, but it was useful to know nun the less.
